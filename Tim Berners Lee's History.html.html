    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE,
a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a
memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[6] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote
the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[7] from 1990 he listed[8] "some of the many
areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
</p>

<p>
    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first
mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[9][10] It describes 18 elements
comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were
strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-
based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[11]
</p>

<p>
    HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and
other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML
markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the
web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO
technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early
text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early
1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting
commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated
ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and
markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

        HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>
            <li>May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables) </li>
            <li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps) </li>
            <li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization) </li>

    HTML 3.2[19] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and 
standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on 
September 12, 1996. [20] 
    </p>
    
<p> 
    Initially code-named "Wilbur", [21] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap 
among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. 
Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. [17] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in 
HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.

        HTML 4.0[22] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden. </li>
            <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed. </li>
            <li> Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
            </ul>
    <p style="margin-bottom: -15px; margin-top: -10px;">
        Initially code-named "Cougar", [21] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and 
        attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by 
        marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming 
        to ISO 8879 – SGML. [23]

followed by six further drafts published by IETF itself [42] that finally led to HTML 2.0 in RFC 1866
